# 👨‍💻 Introduction to DevOps

### **What is DevOps? **
 ```
DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that 
increases an organization’s ability to deliver applications and services at high 
velocity, evolving and improving products at a faster pace than organizations 
using traditional software development and infrastructure management processes. 
 ```

```
 This speed enables organizations to better serve their customers and 
 compete more effectively in the market
``` 


### **DevOps CAMS**

- Culture
```
people → process → tools
```
- Automation
```
Thousands of servers are impossible to manage but do you need thousand servers ?
how much can you automate ? or should you automate ?
``` 
- Measurement
```SQL
It's not just about infra measurement. business measure, client activity 
and other pointers. Recovery time, cycle time are obvious but it's important 
to measure and incentivise it.
``` 
- Sharing
```SQL
share responsibility, share ownership and no escape goat. feedback loop is important
``` 

### **DevOps 3 ways**
- flow thinking
- amplify feedback
- experiment and learn

### **Big Overview**
- People over process over tools
- Continuous delivery
- lean management
- Infrastructure as code

### **IT Divide**
- Developers wants to deliver features fast and deploy them quickly.
- Ops wants system to be stable and uptime is most important to them.

### **DevOps**
- Blameless Postmortems
- transparent downtime
- Integrate team - devs and Ops
- Extension of agile
- IAAC - GIT for ops

### **DevOps Basic Terminologies**

- **Provisioning** -> Server is ready with OS, software and networking

- **Deployment** -> adding or upgrading software on server

- **Orchestration** -> coordinated operations on multiple systems

- **Configuration management** -> managing server configuration via files such as ram, space, dependency softwares etc

- **Imperative (procedural)** -> commands to produce desired state

- **Declarative (procedural)** -> desired state is defined and tools will achieve it

- **idempotent** -> repeat execution and same result

- **blue green deployment** -> Identical deployment, used as switch

- **Continuous Integration** -> Build and unit test at every checkin

- **Continuous Delivery** -> deploy on production live environment at every checkin

- **Continuous Deployment** -> After unit testing, deploy changes to production in small batches
